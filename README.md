In today's fast-paced world, drive-thru services have become an integral part of the food industry, offering customers the convenience of ordering food without leaving their vehicles. However, the drive-thru experience is not without its challenges. The traditional drive-thru ordering process often involves human employees taking orders, which can lead to various issues such as miscommunication, long wait times, order inaccuracies, and increased labor costs for businesses.

## Solution-proposed

To address these challenges and enhance the drive-thru experience for customers and businesses alike, the introduction of Voice AI technology holds significant promise. Voice AI ordering in the drive-thru aims to leverage the power of artificial intelligence and natural language processing to automate the ordering process and improve overall efficiency.

The problem lies in designing and implementing an effective Voice AI ordering system that can seamlessly interact with customers, accurately understand their orders, and efficiently process transactions.
